# SEBA Engineering Website Language System Updates

## Overview of Fixes
This update addresses issues with the language switching functionality on the SEBA Engineering website, particularly focusing on making the EN/TR language buttons work correctly across all pages of the website.

## Files Modified

### JavaScript Files
- **assets/js/language-system.js** (New) - Unified language system that handles initialization, switching, and button handling
- **assets/js/language-enhancer.js** - Fixed error handling and language button behavior
- **assets/js/language-init.js** - Updated to create a proper setLanguage function early in page load
- **assets/js/language-test.js** (New) - Added for automated testing of the language system

### HTML Files
- Updated all HTML files to use the new language-system.js script
- Ensured all language buttons have proper data-lang attributes
- Standardized script loading order across all pages
- Added language-test-page.html for manual testing

## How It Works

### Initialization

1. When a page loads, the `language-system.js` script:
   - Ensures translations are available on the `window` object
   - Creates a reliable `setLanguage` function if it doesn't exist
   - Sets up click handlers for language buttons
   - Applies the current language (from localStorage or defaults to English)
   - Sets up a MutationObserver to handle dynamically added language buttons

### Language Switching

The language system works by:

1. Storing the current language in localStorage
2. Applying translations to elements with `data-lang-key` attributes
3. Updating the HTML `lang` attribute and `data-lang` attribute
4. Updating the active state of language buttons
5. Dispatching a custom event that other components can listen for

## Key Improvements
1. **Unified System** - Created a single system that works identically across all pages
2. **Robust Initialization** - Multiple fallbacks for loading translations and setting up language functions
3. **Better Error Handling** - Comprehensive error logging and recovery mechanisms
4. **Proper Event Handling** - Used proper event listeners instead of inline handlers
5. **Active State Management** - Language buttons now correctly show active state
6. **Automated Testing** - Added test script and test page to verify functionality

## How to Test
1. Open the `language-test-page.html` in a browser to run manual tests
2. Use the test buttons to verify language switching
3. Check for any errors in the browser console (F12)
4. Navigate to different pages and verify that the language persists
5. Verify that all translatable elements are properly updated when switching languages

## Adding New Translatable Content
To make an element translatable:

1. Add a `data-lang-key` attribute to the HTML element
2. The value should be the key in the translations object (e.g., `services.title`)
3. Add translations to the `translations-fixed.js` file under both language objects

## Future Improvements
- Consider using a more robust i18n library for larger translation needs
- Implement lazy loading for translations to improve performance
- Add more language options beyond EN/TR
