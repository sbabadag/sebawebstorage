# SEBA Engineering Website Language System Updates

## Overview of Fixes
This update addresses issues with the language switching functionality on the SEBA Engineering website, particularly focusing on making the EN/TR language buttons work correctly.

## Files Modified

### JavaScript Files
- **assets/js/translations.js** - Ensured TRANSLATIONS is globally available
- **assets/js/language-enhancer.js** - Fixed error handling and language button behavior
- **assets/js/script.js** - Updated language handling functions
- **assets/js/language-init.js** (New) - Added to initialize language system early
- **assets/js/language-diagnostic.js** (New) - Added for troubleshooting
- **assets/js/force-language-update.js** (New) - Created for manual updates if needed
- **sw.js** - Updated cache version and added new JS files

### HTML Files
- Updated all HTML files to use consistent script loading order
- Replaced inline onclick attributes with data-lang attributes
- Added language-init.js to all pages

## Key Improvements
1. **Consistent initialization** - Added language-init.js that runs early in page load
2. **Fixed global availability** - Ensured TRANSLATIONS object is available on the window object
3. **Better error handling** - Added comprehensive error logging
4. **Event-based buttons** - Replaced inline event handlers with proper event listeners
5. **Diagnostic tools** - Added utilities to help identify and fix any remaining issues

## Known Issues
None currently identified. If language switching still doesn't work on some pages, try adding the force-language-update.js script to the problematic page.

## How to Test
1. Open the website in a browser
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click the EN and TR buttons to switch languages
4. Verify that text content changes according to the selected language
5. Check for any errors in the console

## Future Improvements
- Consider using a more robust i18n library
- Implement lazy loading for translations to improve performance
- Add more language options beyond EN/TR
