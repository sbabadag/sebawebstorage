  <h2>About SEBA Engineering & Consultancy</h2>
  <p>We are a dedicated structural engineering and consultancy firm providing expert solutions in reinforced concrete and steel-framed structures. At SEBA, we transform engineering challenges into efficient, buildable, and enduring solutions.</p>
  
  <p>Our expertise spans across the entire project lifecycle—from structural design and detailing to manufacturing and on-site erection. We deliver precision and strength in every component we create. Our projects reflect our deep understanding of structural performance, material behavior, and construction practicality.</p>

  <p>Clients across industrial, commercial, agricultural, and municipal sectors rely on us to engineer steel and concrete systems that are not only structurally sound but also time- and cost-efficient. We pride ourselves on delivering high-performance engineering that meets today’s standards for safety, sustainability, and innovation.</p>

  <p>SEBA is built on hands-on experience, technical excellence, and a commitment to building with integrity. Whether designing a complex steel framework or managing large-scale site assembly, we bring clarity, reliability, and engineering strength to every project.</p>

  <blockquote><strong>“We don’t just build structures. We engineer confidence.”</strong></blockquote>
