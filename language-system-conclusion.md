# SEBA Engineering Website Language System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive solution to fix the language switching functionality on the SEBA Engineering website. The EN/TR language buttons now work correctly across all pages of the site.

## Core Changes Made

1. **Created a unified language system (`language-system.js`)** that:
   - Handles language initialization consistently
   - Properly manages language switching
   - Sets up event listeners for language buttons
   - Updates UI elements when language changes
   - Applies translations immediately

2. **Fixed language button issues**:
   - Ensured all buttons have proper `data-lang` attributes
   - Implemented proper active state management
   - Removed inline event handlers in favor of proper event listeners

3. **Improved translation application**:
   - Added support for nested translation keys
   - Fixed issues with translation application timing
   - Added better error handling for missing translations

4. **Standardized implementation across all pages**:
   - Updated all HTML files to use the same script loading pattern
   - Created a PowerShell script to automatically update all pages

5. **Added testing tools**:
   - Created a dedicated test page for manual testing
   - Added a test script that automatically verifies functionality

## Testing Results

The language switching functionality now works correctly across all pages of the website. Specifically:
- Language buttons correctly switch between EN and TR
- Translations are properly applied to all elements with data-lang-key attributes
- The active language state is preserved between page navigation
- Language buttons show the correct active state

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Follow the established pattern** for adding new translatable content:
   - Always use `data-lang-key` attributes for translatable elements
   - Add new translations to both language objects in `translations-fixed.js`

2. **Test thoroughly** when adding new pages or translatable content:
   - Use the `language-test-page.html` to verify functionality
   - Check the browser console for any errors

3. **Consider future enhancements**:
   - Add support for more languages
   - Implement lazy loading for translations to improve performance
   - Consider using a more robust i18n library for larger translation needs

## Conclusion

The language switching functionality is now fixed and works reliably across all pages of the SEBA Engineering website. Users can now easily switch between English and Turkish, and the site will remember their language preference between visits.
